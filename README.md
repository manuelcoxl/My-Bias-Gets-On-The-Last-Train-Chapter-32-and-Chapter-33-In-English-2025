## 💫 Chapter 32: Behind the Glamour

Chapter 32 starts with a shift in tone—less about public image, more about private pain. The female lead is left wondering whether her growing feelings are real or just a fantasy born from years of being a fan. Meanwhile, the male lead (the "bias") struggles with the pressure of being admired, while feeling **deeply alone** behind the spotlight.

### Key Highlights:

* 🧠 **Inner conflict**: The idol faces questions about his true self versus his public persona.
* 🌃 **Late-night conversation**: A heartfelt talk at the train station becomes the emotional core of the chapter.
* 🧩 **Hints of backstory**: We learn more about his past—possibly explaining why he avoids deep emotional connections.

Chapter 32 ends with both characters seated on the last train—**not saying everything, but feeling everything**.
